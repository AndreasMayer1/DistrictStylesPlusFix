# DistrictStylesPlus

DistrictStylesPlus is a mod for Cities: Skylines which should make easier to manage district styles in the game.

Goals:

- Player should be able to create or delete district style in game
- Player should be able to modify building list in styles in game with imminent effect
- Player should be able to add "vanilla" buildings to district styles
- Player should be able to exclude buildings from "default style" for each save independently


Huge thanks to Bofomer who created Building Themes mod so I could take a lot from it. Also big thanks to other people from C:S modding community (like Algernon, Keallu and others) whom have code of their mods open on GitHub so one can learn and gain from it.
